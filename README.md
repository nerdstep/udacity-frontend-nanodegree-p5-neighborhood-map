## Install

**tl;dr**: Clone this repo and run `$ npm install` in that directory to get started.

### Prerequisites

#### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Bring up a terminal and type `node --version`.
Node should respond with a version at or above 0.10.x.
If you require Node, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big 
green Install button.

#### [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

Bring up a terminal and type `gulp --version`.
If Gulp is installed it should return a version number at or above 3.8.x.
If you need to install/upgrade Gulp, open up a terminal and type in the following:

```sh

```

*This will install Gulp globally. Depending on your user account, you may need 
to [configure your system](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md) 
to install packages globally without administrative privileges.*

#### Local dependencies

Next, install the dependencies:

```sh

That's it! You should now have everything needed to use the Web Starter Kit.
